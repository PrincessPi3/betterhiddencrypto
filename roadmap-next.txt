refactor to eliminate python because python is a tumor and i think i can do it better in shell script anyhoof
make generic argon2id digest function
    output hex string
    use cracklib-check to ensure password strength
    do sanity checks
    take argon2id settings as args / maybe have pre-defined presets it just picks between via arg $1
make generic aes encryption and decryption functions
    use openssl
    feed it raw key hex string
    feed it randomly generated iv hex string
    append(?) the iv bytes/hex string I think
make iv extracting and appending functions
    work just like retrieve_7z_salt and append_7z_salt ig
    chops off the bytes and xxd -p em to hash string
    maybe actually store as hex string? maybe easier and more stable
make and clean up iv/salt generation function
    length via $1
    iv, 7z salt, and aes salt all changed to globals
    output hex string
    ~openssl rand -hex $n
support asshole yum usin linuxfuckers
sanity checks
    sanity checks on closing ramdisk
    redundant tests of each step before proceeding?
nuke/nuke reboot ask for confirm?
run out from one single shell script
    curl download installer oneliner frong (for ez and in case dey want it in their PATH)
autoinstaller on missing environment shit
    setup environment re ramdisk and file init
documentation
    update packages list
    update usage
    tidy up and spell out proper usage
        key selection
        key storage
        key backups
        tell em about
            threat model
                forensics
                theif
                    high end
                    low end
                malware
                leaks
                    password leaks from third party platforms
                    key/passphrase/secrets leak from betterhiddencrypto
                social engineering
            
optional offline haveibeenpwned testing?
remove vestigial code and comments
make generic functions for iv/salt generation, as well as iv/salt appending and retrieving
    dis way dey can be resused yyayy
    try to handle dem only as hex strings because fuckin nullbytes jfc god damned fuck
maybe fuckin rename those dickfuck file/archive var names they confusing as shit
