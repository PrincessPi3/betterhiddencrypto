cross platform
standards compliant ironclad trusted libs
strict version and library/prerequiite version logging

need to replace deez tools
and/or refactor away
    shred
    7zip
    openssl
        sub any cryptographically secure cryptographic rng
    find
    printf
    truncate
    cp
    mv
    cat
    mkdir
    some kinda memory space like
        %tmp% (cmd)
        $env:tmp (ps)
        /tmp (*nix)
        ramdisk??
    sha512

refactoring changesss
    7z crypto KDF
        real KDF argon2id
        real salt
        then passed through sha512?
            will bytes work too? :thining:
    all tags, ivs, and salts will be PREPENDED if practical to make antiforensics more effective with just the first few bytes
