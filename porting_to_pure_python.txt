cross platform
standards compliant ironclad trusted libs
strict version and library/prerequiite version logging

need to replace deez tools
and/or refactor away
    shred
    7zip
    openssl
        sub any cryptographically secure cryptographic rng
    find
    printf
    truncate
    cp
    mv
    cat
    mkdir
    some kinda memory space like
        %tmp% (cmd)
        $env:tmp (ps)
        /tmp (*nix)
        ramdisk??
    sha512(?)
    force shutdown

refactoring changesss
    7z crypto KDF
        real KDF argon2id
        real salt
        then passed through sha512?
            will bytes work too? :thining:
    all tags, ivs, and salts will be PREPENDED if practical to make antiforensics more effective with just the first few bytes

implementations
    hidden volume(?)
    gui(?)

installer
    requirements.txt because fuckem

crypto tests:
    loop KDF for both layers
        dieharder correlation testing
        entropy testing
            visualizations
            charts
            calculated values
        dieharder randomness testing
    loop encrypt same data with random passphrase
        entropy testing
            visualizations
            charts
            calculated values
        dieharder random testing
    hidden volume
        loop encrypt/decrypt and hidden encrypt/decrypt
            dieharder correlation teating
            dieharder randomness testing
