hammer offline card for leaked bytes
    also leaked partial bytes
    also do hexdump analysis of the file system to try and find any remnants of empty directories
        figure out some way to make them vanish (srm again?)
hammer linux for leaks
hammer WSL for leaks
hammer memory for leaks
hammer for directory information leaks
full on forensic analysis
work on antiforensics
x rework readme
    x witches idea to append/prepend memorized string to stored pass for dual custody typr thinggg
    x actual instructions for usage
    x add mention of 7z crypto
readme
    flesh out how the modes work
    add nuke and antiforensics details
    prettify it
    add first pass digest/salt info
    add laymen usage for a normie to use it durably
        onedrive/cloud issue
        backup/file history issue
        beached pass issue
        secure pass creation
            kara's tip
        key management
        backing up encrypted data and keys durably
            backups leak issue again
x add password security 
add breached passwords check
X shred all volume crypto headers mode (shred --zero --remove --size=N (bytes))
    X also check for and shred any dangling files
    verify data durability in failure modes
    verify that enough bytes are shredded to reliably nuke it
    multithread nuke
    highest priority task setting?
x add smart optin to include dir or file on cli, or prombt for
x removed make install mode fuckin work
x prevent those errors when a .volume.bin or .volume.bin.bak is found
add network killswitch?
add configurable cron/backup operation kill/pause?
y make the sha512sum digest for 7z go through iterations and maybe use a salt
x    or find better alternative mayhaps
test install instructions
x add nuke options to help mode
make nuke silent
x verify salts are being used and stored and in digest
sanity check shit and error check
add known weaknesses to cryptanalysis readme
    both salts are leaked in the archive
        but their prsence still makes it far more robust against attack
        discuss the sha512 digest thinggg
            seek commentary
        discuss the 7z being used and the security threats involved in that
            seek commentary
refactor into platform independant pure python?
    compiled python exe?
    gui for nomies? (REEEEE)
