added cryptanalysis/clean_up.sh to clean up any generated file (USE WITH CARE)
added cryptanalysis/hammer_for_bytes.sh as tooling to hunt for leaks
added cryptanalysis/checksums.sh to genreate sha256 checksums of all the files in to_encrypt (if present) as well as all .volume.bin files and their backups: .volume.bin.bak and those in .volume_old
improved readme
